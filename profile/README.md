# Welcome to the ACCESS-NRI GitHub Organisation 👋

## About us

ACCESS-NRI supports [ACCESS models: Australia's climate modelling infrastructure for the Australian research community](https://access-hive.org.au/models/).

ACCESS-NRI is committed to open source development because it enables scrutiny and review, which 
is the best way to develop research critical software. 

For a socially essential service like climate modelling it is even more important to make climate models the best 
they can be and trusted sources of information for the future.

ACCESS-NRI is hosted by the [Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au) and funded by the Australian 
Federal Government through the [National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS)](https://www.education.gov.au/ncris).

## ACCESS-NRI GitHub Organisation

This GitHub organisation is open for all to view. All repositories are public where licensing allows, and as an
organisation we welcome contributions. For administrative and security reasons the preferred method is by
[forking](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks)
and [creating pull requests from your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

To easily find repositories within this GitHub Organisation, we recommend using
the [GitHub search
function](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-for-repositories)
along with
[topics](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics).
ACCESS-NRI repositories are tagged with a few different categories of topics that should make it easy to find specific repositories:
- Models: [`access-am3`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Aaccess-am3+&type=repositories), [`access-cm2`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Aaccess-cm2+&type=repositories), [`access-cm3`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Aaccess-cm3+&type=repositories), [`access-esm1p5`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Aaccess-esm1p5+&type=repositories), [`access-esm1p6`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Aaccess-esm1p6+&type=repositories), [`access-esm3`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Aaccess-esm3+&type=repositories), [`access-om2`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Aaccess-om2+&type=repositories), [`access-om3`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Aaccess-om3+&type=repositories), [`access-ram3`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Aaccess-ram3+&type=repositories), [`access-issm`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Aaccess-issm+&type=repositories), [`cable`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Acable+&type=repositories), [`roms`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Aroms+&type=repositories)

- Earth systems: [`atmosphere`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Aatmosphere+&type=repositories), [`biogeochemistry`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Abiogeochemistry+&type=repositories), [`coupler`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Acoupler+&type=repositories), [`cryosphere`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Acryosphere+&type=repositories), [`land`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Aland+&type=repositories), [`ocean`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Aocean+&type=repositories), [`sea-ice`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Asea-ice+&type=repositories), [`waves`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Awaves+&type=repositories)

Different topics can be combined within the same search. For example, to find
all repositories storing ACCESS-OM3 configurations, one can combine the [`access-om3` and
`configuration`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AACCESS-NRI+topic%3Aaccess-om3+topic%3Aconfiguration+&type=repositories) topics.

More information and a full list of available topics can be found
[here](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/dev-docs/wiki/GitHub-Organizations#topic-tags).

## Community

ACCESS-NRI exists to serve the Australian research community, and provides a number of services to engage and
support the community apart from the software infrastructure services:

[ACCESS Hive Forum](https://forum.access-hive.org.au)


ACCESS-NRI also provides the [ACCESS Community Hub GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub) as an open and shared organisation for community projects.
